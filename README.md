Dashboard App creation via Python Dash
Visualize and create a model
Dashboard App 
Our use case lets users visualise datasets without having any dependencies on the technical prerequisites. The aim here is to provide users with a dashboard driven machine learning tool. Some parallels of this tool are Tableau and weka. The powerful edge that the tool has is that no download of any shorts is needed. Our Tool is completely cloud based. The ease this gives is that even the non technical members of the group can use the aspects of machine learning easily. As we know the demand for the cloud based solution is rising every quarter. Due to this wide utility of cloud based solution I have implemented the solution on a cloud platform Heroku and AWS. Moreover the project is available on Github too for further research and development. In today's times the size of data is increasing day by day. Thus making it very critical to have a GUI driven cloud hosted ML tool that runs just like a blogging or any other site.
We notice that the dashboard approach is also something that many tools tend to integrate these days. I have followed the same trend and implemented a dashboard approach rather than logging the event system for any particular data point. This dashboard is used to do following functionality :
i.) visualize the datasets and download its report( consists of accuracy, val_accuracy, loss and val_loss), shows as accuracy and loss graphs and .h5 extension model using artificial neural networks with different types of activation function and optimizers.
ii.) visualize the datasets and download its report( consists of accuracy, val_accuracy, loss and val_loss), shows as accuracy and loss graphs and .h5 extension model using inverse artificial neural networks with different types of activation function and optimizers. Note: Work is still in progress.
iii.) creates model and report/results for image dataset ( in available online platform data should not exceeds 100Mb capacity), shows as accuracy and loss graphs. We can also test the model by providing input image to the online application and classify its output.
Installation Manual with deployment in Heroku.

Every Dash script so far has used app.run_server() to launch the app. By default the app runs on localhost, and you can only see it on your own machine.

The good news is that Dash uses Flask as its web framework, so anywhere you can deploy Flask, you can deploy Dash. While there are many options out there including Digital Ocean, PythonAnywhere, Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Azure, etc., we’ll walk through an app deployment on Heroku.

We can run the application in two ways:
Steps to install in your own computer:

Step 1 -  Clone project form Git

Use below command on command prompt to clone the project form git or directly download the project from github.
	git clone https://github.com/ascoolakash/demo-easy-dash

 
STEP 2 - Directed to Development Folder

Extract the downloaded or cloned development folder, then move to the development folder:
	C:\>cd demo_easy_dash
STEP 3 (WINDOWS) - Create virtualenv and download all the dependencies:
see below for macOS/Linux instructions!
1. Create a virtual environment. We’re calling ours “venv” but you can use any name you want:
	C:\my_dash_app>python -m virtualenv venv
2. Activate the virtual environment:
	C:\my_dash_app>.\venv\Scripts\activate 
3. Install dash and any desired dependencies into your virtual environment
	(venv) C:\my_dash_app>pip install -r requirements.txt


STEP 3 (macOS/Linux) - Create virtualenv and download all the dependencies:

1. Create a virtual environment. We’re calling ours “venv” but you can use any name you want:
	
	$ python3 -m virtualenv venv
	
2. Activate the virtual environment:
	
	$ source venv/bin/activate

3. Install dash and any desired dependencies into your virtual environment

	$ pip install -r requirements.txt

STEP 4 - Run the program:

You can run the program by below code:
	python app3.py

Steps of deployment:

STEP 1 - Install Heroku and Git

Heroku is a cloud platform that lets users deploy apps on the web.

Git is a version control system that will let you keep a local copy of your app for development, and enable you to push changes from your development copy to the deployed version stored at Heroku.

1. Open a Heroku account. Free accounts are available at https://signup.heroku.com/dc 

Follow the instructions to obtain a username and password. Write them down! 

2. Log into your Heroku account. It should take you to https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps 

3. Click on Python. On the next screen select Set Up. An option should appear to download the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI). Choose your operating system from the dropdown list and follow the instructions to install the utility. You should have the option to install Git as well.

4. If git was not installed with Heroku CLI, you can download it directly from https://git-scm.com/downloads and follow the instructions for your operating system.

STEP 2 - Install virtualenv

1. Install virtualenv if you don’t already have it by typing pip install virtualenv at your terminal. Virtualenv allows you to create virtual environments for your app that house Python and all the dependencies your app requires. This includes specific version of plotly, dash, and other libraries that you know will work. 
As new updates become available, they won’t break your app until you’ve had a chance to test them first!

STEP 3 - Create a Development Folder

1. Create a new folder for your project. This will house the “development” copy of your app:
	C:\>mkdir demo_easy_dash
	C:\>cd demo_easy_dash


STEP 4 - Initialize Git

1. Initialize an empty git repository:
	C:\demo_easy_dash>git init
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/demo_easy_dash/.git/
STEP 5 (WINDOWS) - Create, Activate and Populate a virtualenv
see below for macOS/Linux instructions!
1. Create a virtual environment. We’re calling ours “venv” but you can use any name you want:
C:\my_dash_app>python -m virtualenv venv
2. Activate the virtual environment:
C:\my_dash_app>.\venv\Scripts\activate 
3. Install dash and any desired dependencies into your virtual environment
(venv) C:\demo_easy_dash>pip install dash
(venv) C:\demo_easy_dash>pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Install a new dependency gunicorn for deploying the app:
(venv) C:\my_dash_app>pip install gunicorn


STEP 5 (macOS/Linux) - Create, Activate and Populate a virtualenv

1. Create a virtual environment. We’re calling ours “venv” but you can use any name you want:
	$ python3 -m python3 -m virtualenv venv
2. Activate the virtual environment:
	$ source venv/bin/activate
3. Install dash and any desired dependencies into your virtual environment
	$ pip install  -r requirements.txt
4. Install a new dependency gunicorn for deploying the app:
	$ pip install gunicorn


STEP 6 - Add Files to the Development Folder

The following files need to be added:

app3.py	a Dash application

.gitignore	
used by git, identifies files that won’t be pushed to production

Procfile	
used for deployment

requirements.txt	
describes your Python dependencies, can be created automatically

.gitignore

venv

*.pyc

.DS_Store

.env

Procfile

web: gunicorn app3:server

app1 refers to the filename of our application (app1.py) and server refers to the variable server inside that file.

requirements.txt

This can be automatically generated by running pip freeze > requirements.txt at the terminal. 
Make sure to do it from inside the development folder with the virtual environment activated.

(venv) C:\demo_easy_dash>pip freeze > requirements.txt

STEP 6 - Log onto your Heroku Account

At the terminal, login using the credentials you established in STEP1:

(venv) C:\demo_easy_dash>heroku login

Enter your Heroku credentials:

Email: my.name@somewhere.com

Password: ********

Logged in as my.name@somewhere.com

STEP 7 - Initialize Heroku, add files to Git, and Deploy

(venv) C:\demo_easy_dash>heroku create my-dash-app 

You have to change my-dash-app to a unique name. The name must start with a letter and can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes.

(venv) C:\demo_easy_dash>git add . 

Note the period at the end. This adds all files to git (except those listed in .gitignore)

(venv) C:\demo_easy_dash>git commit -m "Initial launch"

Every git commit should include a brief descriptive comment. Depending on your operating system, this comment may require double-quotes (not single-quotes).

(venv) C:\demo_easy_dash>git push heroku master 

This deploys your current code to Heroku. The first time you push may take awhile as it has to set up Python and all your dependencies on the remote server.

(venv) C:\demo_easy_dash>heroku ps:scale web=1 

Scaling dynos... done, now running web at 1:Free
This runs the app with a 1 heroku "dyno"

STEP 8 - Visit Your App on the Web!

You should be able to view your app at https://my-dash-app.herokuapp.com
(changing my-dash-app to the name of your app)

STEP 9 - Update Your App

Any time you make changes to your app, add new apps to your repo, or install new libraries and/or upgrade existing dependencies in your virtual environment, you want to push the latest updates to Heroku. 
These are the basic steps:

If installing a new package:

$ pip install newdependency

$ pip freeze > requirements.txt

If updating an existing package:

$ pip install dependency --upgrade

$ pip freeze > requirements.txt

In all cases:

$ git status # view the changes (optional)

$ git add .  # add all the changes

$ git commit -m "a description of the changes"

$ git push heroku master
